# Template for custom kiosk browser

Ever since the day I read that Wrap for Power Apps was ammounced, I was over the moon. It allowed me to create a company branded app for mobile devices.

While it would be nice if Microsoft also done the same for Windows ([Power Apps](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9MVC8P1Q3B29)) we are not there yet.

For now I decided to setup something that is rather simple, nothing too crazy and self contained.
